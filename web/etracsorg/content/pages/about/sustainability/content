With information technology, everything needs to move fast and be up to date to remain relevant.
With or without grants, Rameses is committed to ensuring that E-TRACS will always be at the forefront of technology. 
In less than 3 years, E-TRACS has undergone two major revisions and several incremental updates. Each revision has included important
features and provided solutions to address previous problems.  
</p>

<p>
Initially, E-TRACS is included as a project component of grants wherein the LGU gets the free software,
and depending on the grant, also hardware. Rameses works with these grant providers through 
a managing company to deploy the system and provide various trainings to the LGUs. E-TRACS can be run 
online usually after two weeks implementation. Most LGUs using the system have benefitted and through 
the efficiency of the system, they have experienced growth in their revenue since they have become more 
disciplined in their processes.      
</p>

<p>
However after the grant ends, the project usually has difficulty continuing unless it can be sustained. For it to
be effective, it needs to be supported in case there are new problems encountered, there are new directions from the national office or
new reporting requirements. To solve this problem, Rameses provides membership to the E-TRACS sustainability program. For a reasonably small annual fee,    
the funds will be used to continue development and improvements of E-TRACS. The concept is like a bayanihan system, wherein each
LGU will commit a small share for sustainability for the benefit of everybody. Each member will have access to the latest
updates and developments of E-TRACS. To achieve the vision of true modernization, each member will be given access to advanced trainings,
and help LGUs move effectively to emerging technologies, like cloud computing and mobile technologies.
